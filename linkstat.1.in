.SH DESCRIPTION

.\" ----- overview -----
Linkstat is tool to monitor network interfaces.
.PP
.\" ----- usage overview -----
Its aim is to provide a quick accurate method of monitoring system uptime.
Using this program it is possible to get an immediate update when
a system goes down.  It is also possible to calculate the uptime
of a system and track when systems (WinNT) crash and automatically
reboot.
.PP
.\" ----- design overview -----
When started each host listed is processed one at a time and sent
an ICMP packet followed by a 10ms pause (configured through the
"interval" parameter).  If at the end of this process we are still
waiting for some ICMP packets to return then we increase the
pause interval by 2ms.  This will give each ICMP packet a little
longer to return.  If after ten consecutive cycles we are not
waiting for any packets then the pause interval starts to decrement
by one for each ten cycles (for example if after 30 cycles we are
still not waiting on any packets, then the pause interval will be
decremented by 3ms during each cycle).  This process stops when
either we hit the minimum interval (default 10ms) or we encounter
an outstanding packet.

At the end of each cycle we wait 1000ms (configured through the
"timeout" parameter) for any outstanding packets.  This also has
effect of pausing for at lease a second between cycles.

If a packet is not received from a host after 3 consecutive cycles
(configured through the "retry" parameter) then the host is
considered to be "down".  A host is considered to be "up" as soon
as any packet is received from it.

.SH STARTING LINKSTAT
Starting linkstat can be as simple as:
.B linkstat -f /etc/hosts

.\" ----- overview -----
.SH HOST FILE
.TP
.BI "IPAddr Hostname" " # (int=freq,ret=num,mon=HHMM:hhmm)"
While the items after the "#" are optional, if you wish to use them they
must appear in that order.  The currently supported options are as follows:
 int=<frequency> - Sets how often to check the host (secs)
 ret=<number>    - Sets the max number of packet retransmits
 mon=<HHMM:hhmm> - Monitor between the hours of HHMM and hhmm
